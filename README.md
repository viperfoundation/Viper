# Viper

![viper logo](/viper-logo.jpg)

**Viper** – a private messenger built on the decentralized transport layer of TON (ADNL protocol). 

It uses a relay server to forward messages between participants globally.

## Highlights

🔹 Chat anywhere – send messages across countries instantly.

🔹 Encrypted messages – only you and your peer can read them; the relay does not know the content.

🔹 No phone number/email required to register – just your mnemonic phrase or private/public crypto keys to start.

🔹 Simple and fast – apps (macOS/iOS) lightweight and distraction-free.

**Rolling Closed Beta** – currently in private testing with early adopters.
